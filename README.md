Our Final Project - Mark, Shantanu, Taiga

This project took us a while.
It was so much fun.

Mark was the assests designer and the passionate guy in the group.
Tiaga was the game desinger, audiophile and kept us on our toes.
Shantanu did almost no work but I did do some scripts.

It was a fun time.

We have a forest section, a platforming section, and a cave which is a work in progress.
The master scene is Title.tscn

There is a cutscene before the game starts, so enjoy.

THANK YOU
